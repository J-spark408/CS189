/*Make Square and Circle classes.
Make a base class for both called Shape
Two methods: SetSize and GetArea
(Size of an edge for square and the radius for circle)
Put those two methods where you think they should go.  Avoid duplication and make sure Shape is polymorphic
To test these classes, do the following

Make a vector of Shape pointers
(If you haven't ever seen vectors, it's "std::vector<Shape*> shapes;")
Dynamically create some circles and squares and put them in the vector
(That's the push_back command.)
Loop through vector calling GetArea on each Shape
(The actual size of anything doesn't matter.  Don't waste your time making a menu and using input though.)
Make sure you have no memory leaks
